# RAT GAME 15
forgot i am NOT remembering to update the readme with yk. updates
so this might be here a minute

I'm using this iteration of Rat Game to learn C++. 
However, I'm by no means good at writing neat/readable/professional code (having never taken a formal class on the subject) 
so it might end up a mess. R@@UI is pronounced ratatouille and stands for Rat @ User Interface. 
This is because there will be a rat in there. Remote access? Who knows, maybe. Probably not. 
I'll welcome advice on code.

I should mention this probably so to run it you need your own install of curses/ncurses and will need 
to reconfigure the compile script to reflect that. You can figure the rest out yourself, probably. 
It's on the roadmap to add internal graphics system ports / compatability for different graphics systems i.e. 
whatever the hell is on windows, probably through raylib or raygpu as to not run output on the terminal and be able to 
utilize the gpu
